console.log(Math.floor(1.9)); // Even thou first decimal digit is 9 which is greater than 5 and after round off it should be 2, but still it will give 1 due to floor method as it takes low value.

// Random method

// Now if we need to have random number between 1 and 10. What we will do?

let min=1; //We have min range 1 and max range 10 and we need to have random number between 1 to 10.
let max=10;
// first we will multiply our random number to 10 so we will get number greater than 1. But if we have 
// any random number having 0s in first 2 decimal placed, then we will get 0 only. So to be on safe side, we will add that number with 1 as well.
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*10)+1); // To remove decimals, we can add Math.floor() method.



// Now we have to print any random number between 10 and 20. create a code using random method.

let min=10;
let max=20;

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*10)+min);// This will give our number between 10 and 20.
