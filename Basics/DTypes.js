/* There are different types of Data Types in Javascript but are little sorted as compare to other languages like number
datatype includes all number types like int, float whereas in jS, number data type is used for both. Lets understand below 
mostly used data types in JS. */

console.log(`Akshay`); //This type of DT is called string which is write within ``,'' or ""
console.log(4); // This type of DT is called Number where we use all kind of numbers.

isActive=true
console.log(isActive); // This type of DT is called Boolean dt where we get o/p in True or False.

console.log(null) // We have another DT Null which means value is empty.

console.log(undefined) // Another DT is there known as undefined which basically states that our output is undefined. Means variable is declared but value is not defined yet.

console.log(BigInt(2)) // BigInt is DT for Big Integers

// Symbol // Symbol is a DT used for special characters. Mainly used in React

// Above Data types are called primitive data types which are pre defined.

// We have another Data type as well called Object which we will learn later on.

// To know type of data, we can simply check by console.log(typeof "akshay"/variable)
